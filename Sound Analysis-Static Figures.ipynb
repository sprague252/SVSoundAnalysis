A spectrogram is a 3-D plot. One axis (usually the x-axis) is time. The second axis (usually the y-axis) is frequency. The z-axis (represented by color) is power spectral density, which represents how much signal power is in that frequency bin.

Increasing the number of FFT samples increases the frequency resolution, but it decreases the time resolution because each power spectrum slice takes more time (more samples = more time). The second important parameter is the overlap between FFTs. This means the samples used for each FFT contain some of the samples from the previous FFT. The optimal overlap is half of the points used for each FFT.  In other words, it you use 2048 points for your FFT, the optimal overlap would be 1024 points.
